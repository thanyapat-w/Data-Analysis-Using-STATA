----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cash [COA:ACSH]
Cash [ACSH] represents cash on hand, balances on demand deposits, and near-term savings and time deposits. These should be readily available for use and must be free from any contractual restrictions that limit their use in satisfying debts and other operational cash needs. When cash includes short-term investments and deposits, it is classified as Cash and Equivalents [ACAE] rather than as Cash [ACSH].
Cash [ACSH] includes:
Cash in transit
Cash in banks
Petty cash
Cash [ACSH] excludes:
Due from banks (classified as Cash & Due From Banks [ACDB])
Time deposits in banks (due within 90 days) (classified as Cash & Equivalents [ACAE])

Cash in trust (“trust” is treated the same way as “restriction”)
Short-term paper and CD's, when maturity is less than 3 months (classified as Cash & Cash Equivalents [ACAE])

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cash and Equivalents [COA:ACAE]
Cash and Equivalents [ACAE] represents short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so close to their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in interest rates. Only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under these definitions. When cash is delineated separately it is classified as Cash [ACSH], rather than as Cash and Equivalents [ACAE].
Cash and Equivalents [ACAE] includes:
Deposits with financial service companies other than commercial banks

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short-Term Investments [COA:ASTI]
Short-Term Investments [ASTI] consists of any investments in debt and equity securities with maturity of one year or less. The “short-term” nature depends on actual maturity of one year from the balance sheet date rather than on the original maturity of a specific investment. When a company reports its assets without segregation between current and non-current, all investments are classified as Long-Term Investments - Other [ALTI].
Short-Term Investments [ASTI] includes:
Short-term loans
Certificates of deposits (with maturity of 3 to 12 months)
Short-term paper (with maturity of 3 to 12 months)

Accounts Receivable – Trade, Net [COA:AACR]
Accounts Receivable – Trade, Net [AACR] represents claims held against customers for goods sold or services rendered as part of normal business operations.
Value in Accounts Receivable – Trade, Net [AACR] is normally Accounts Receivable – Trade, Gross [AARG] reduced by Provision for Doubtful Accounts [APDA]. However, when the receivables are reported net of provision for doubtful accounts, Accounts Receivable – Trade, Net [AACR] is used, instead of Gross [AARG] and Provision [APDA].
When a company's balance sheet does not delineate between current and non-current notes receivables, all are classified as Notes Receivable – Long Term [ALTR].
Accounts Receivable – Trade, Net [AACR] includes:
Rent receivable in real estate operations companies
Advisory fees receivable in investment service companies
Accounts receivable from unconsolidated subsidiaries, joint ventures, and limited partners
Interest receivables in non-banking financial service companies

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accounts Receivable – Trade, Gross [COA:AARG]
Accounts Receivable – Trade, Gross [AARG] represents receivables from sales of trading assets (such as inventories) or from services provided. Trade accounts receivable are restricted to “current” assets, where “current” is defined as one year or one operating cycle of the company, whichever is longer. This information is classified as Accounts Receivable – Trade, Gross [AARG] only when it is presented as such on the company's balance sheet or in its notes.
When sales receipts are exchanged with a promissory note, such notes are treated as Notes Receivable – Short-Term [ASTR]. However, when such delineation between accounts receivable and notes receivable is not clear, notes receivable are classified as Accounts Receivable [AARG].
Receivables from the sale of merchandise or services provided to affiliates or other related companies are treated as “trade” receivables and included in Accounts Receivable – Trade, Gross [AARG].
Some companies report their trade accounts receivable, net of provision for doubtful accounts, and also provide the doubtful account value on the balance sheet. When this occurs, Thomson Reuters calculates an Account Receivable – Trade, Gross [AARG] value and enter the value for Provision for Doubtful Accounts [APDA] on the balance sheet. When a company does not delineate between notes receivable and accounts receivable, and the information is provided in one line as notes and accounts receivable, Thomson Reuters classifies the figure as Accounts Receivable – Trade, Net [AACR].
Accounts Receivable – Trade, Gross [AARG] includes:
Factored receivables (with recourse)

(Short-term) Loans to third parties (classified as Short Term Investments [ASTI])
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Provision for Doubtful Accounts [COA:APDA]
Provision for Doubtful Accounts [APDA] represents provisions established for doubtful accounts receivable. Provision for doubtful accounts is usually established on the basis of maturities of receivables and the company's experience on collecting such receivables.
Since this is an asset account, Provision for Doubtful Accounts [APDA] is established as a contra account to receivables and expressed in a negative figure.
Provision for Doubtful Accounts [APDA] includes:
Provision for the current portion of long-term receivables (other than trade receivables)
Provision for Doubtful Accounts [APDA] excludes:

Receivables – Other [AORC]
However, if a company reports its receivables without any of the above details, the reported receivables are classified as Total Receivables, Net [ATRC].
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes Receivable – Short-Term [COA:ASTR]
Notes Receivable – Short-Term [ASTR] represents promissory notes received in exchange for goods sold or services rendered by a company to customers in the normal course of business.
Receivables from customers qualify as “current” as long as their maturities are within one year or one operating cycle, whichever is longer. This implies that there are no non-current trade notes receivable. When a non-differentiated balance sheet is utilized, receivables are classified as Notes Receivable – Long Term [ALTR].
Notes Receivable – Short-Term [ASTR] includes:
Loans to customers (gross or net of provision for loan losses) in non-banking financial service companies
Provision for loan losses on loans to customers in non-banking financial service companies (reported as a negative figure)

Prepaid Expenses [COA:APPY]
Prepaid Expenses [APPY] represents goods or services that have already been purchased, but not fully consumed or used.
